Below is the description from Browning. These rifles that were produced in Belgium, vs Japan, have become highly collectible. Based upon condition and grade, these commonly sell for 700 to several thousands of dollars. This rifle has been well maintained, and only shows very minor signs of wear and age. The takedown mechanism is tight, and locks well for accuracy. This is a great shooting, fun rifle. I have more pictures, if you are interested.    Browning Description  Auto 22  Semi-Auto-22. A living tribute to the genius of Browning.  Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. It stands alone as one of the first autoloading rimfires, and one the most desirable rifles ever made. The SA-22 was one of the last of John M. Browning’s designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22’s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Surely these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms.    Action  Takedown autoloader with bottom ejection. Gun is 21 long when taken down.    Receiver  Engraved with scroll design and a polished, blued finish.    Sights  Bead front. Adjustable, folding leaf rear.   Barrel  Drilled and tapped to accept a scope mount.   Safety  Manual trigger-blocking, mounted on trigger guard.   Magazine  Tubular. Capacity: 10 Long Rifles. Feeds through hole in stock.   Stock and Forearm  Select American walnut. Checkered with polished finish.","   Guns for Sale    Rifles   Browning Belgium Auto 22 Takedown","$750"
